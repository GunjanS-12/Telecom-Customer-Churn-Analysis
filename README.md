# Customer Churn Analysis (Telecom Dataset)

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem in the telecom industry, where acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to identify key factors influencing churn.
